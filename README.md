## üåç Problem

In the residential rental market, landlords face significant challenges in efficiently evaluating potential tenants. Traditional background checks and manual income verifications are time-consuming, costly, and often inconsistent, leading to poor tenant-landlord matches and increased financial risks. Renters, on the other hand, seek a transparent and streamlined application process that respects their privacy while fairly representing their financial and rental histories.

There is a need for a digital platform that allows landlords to easily collect rental applications, automatically verify renter information ‚Äî including background checks, credit reports, and income statements ‚Äî and leverage AI to generate consistent, data-driven risk scores for prospective tenants. This platform should enhance decision-making for landlords while providing renters with a smooth, transparent, and fair application experience.
The application is an AI-driven rental platform hosted on Azure Cloud, using App Service for deployment, Blob Storage for renter and property photos, and Cosmos DB for secure data storage, enabling landlords to collect renter applications, verify background and income information, and receive automated risk scores for tenant selection.

# Make a user for both the Renter profile or Landlord profile
-  Landlord profile will allow you to make a house listing and look at your dashboard
- Then go make a renter profile and you can apply to the house just created by landlord profile.
- Once renter has applied go back into landlord profile and AI will provide a risk score in the dashboard of the Renter user that applied to your house.
